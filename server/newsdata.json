Since Velocity customers already use Insights on a daily basis, we integrated ChatGPT with the same interface that they leverage for driving business decisions.\"\n\nAccording to Velocity, the integration of ChatGPT with the Velocity Insights will help the e-commerce giants by offering them AI-powered business solutions in a conversational manner. This will help them to grow and free up their critical business functions.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Electronics and IT is planning to integrate ChatGPT with WhatsApp to help Indian farmers understand and learn about several government schemes, as per a report. Notably, a report from The Indian Express suggests that Bhashini, a team at Meity, is testing the WhatsApp chatbot powered by ChatGPT.\n\nAs per the report, ChatGPT powered WhatsApp chatbot will help users by answering their queries sent through voice notes. It will primarily come handy to those Indian farmers who might not be familiar with typing on smartphones. It is noteworthy that Satya Nadella, CEO at Microsoft, also mentioned at the World Economic Forum that Indian farmers would soon be able to utilise a GPT interface to access a government program using the internet.\n\nMoreover, the report adds that a ChatGPT model powering WhatsApp chatbot was displayed to Nadella. However, the integration of ChatGPT with WhatsApp for farmers might take some time because the AI program currently works on inputs fed in the English language and lacks support for local languages. An official also stated to the publication that large datasets of the several local Indian languages need to be created to train the AI chatbot on them.",

    "Title": "ChatGPT is a 'horrible product': OpenAI CEO Sam Altman",
    "Text": "ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI, has been called a \"horrible product\" by CEO Sam Altman in a recent podcast interview. However, Altman didn't comment on the nature of ChatGPT but on its overall product and current status. Altman cited ChatGPT's frequent error messages, simplistic design, and capacity issues as significant problems.\n\nAltman, in a recent podcast Hard Fork by New York Times, highlighted the product's major flaws. He said, \"ChatGPT is a horrible product. It was really not designed to be used.\" He further claimed that it is not a well-integrated product yet.\n\nAlso WATCH: Chetan Sharma Sting Operation: What BCCI chief selector said on Kohli-Ganguly, Hardik Pandya, Rohit Sharma & More\n\nChatGPT is prone to breaking down, telling users it is at capacity, or rejecting their queries. He claimed that the user needs to go through a long-drawn process to get work done by ChatGPT.\n\nAltman also commented on the recent integration of a new ChatGPT language model with Microsoft Bing. He claimed that the addition of citations under a Bing search result will help deal with false information. Altman claimed that the accuracy and the utility of the new AI-powered Bing has been significantly improved over the ChatGPT experience.\n\nGreg Brockman, another OpenAI cofounder, had recently admitted that ChatGPT was launched in its current form as a last resort, after internal issues with beta testers.\n\nChatGPT's Instant Success\n\nDespite its flaws, ChatGPT has quickly gained a large following. One week after its launch, it had one million users, growing quicker than Instagram and TikTok. Altman conceded that the technology behind ChatGPT is \"cool,\" but acknowledged that it is far from a \"great, well-integrated product yet\". The new version of Bing, however, is not available to all users. They will first have to join a waiting list using their email IDs.\n\nThe ChatGPT bot, which launched in November, has quickly become a viral sensation, disrupting the education field and helping students with their essays and exams. The bot is also skilled at writing job application cover letters, lines of code, and articles. In fact, Bill Gates has even praised ChatGPT, saying it will \"change our world\".\n\nAlso read: 'Google was hesitant': Alphabet chairman opens up about ChatGPT-rival Bard",

    "Title": "ChatGPT is a cool and horrible product, says OpenAI CEO Sam Altman",
    "Text": "By Ankita Garg: OpenAI Co-founder and CEO Sam Altman asserted in a podcast with NYT that its company\u2019s ChatGPT tool is a \u201chorrible product,\u201d which comes as a big surprise. He highlighted a few errors that the tool made and the issues that are associated with it.\n\nHe further went on to say that the ChatGPT \u201cwas really not designed to be used\u201d and that it is a horrible product. Though a lot of people who have used it for a lot of things won\u2019t likely agree with him. According to the reports, the AI tool has been used by people to quickly write essays to get a passing grade. The site has also helped generate writing content on any subject.\n\nadvertisement\n\nChatGPT became popular after just one week of launch in November and the AI-backed chatbot is reportedly being used by millions of users right now. The idea of an AI tool helping people immediately find answers to their queries or getting some work done worked greatly in favour of ChatGPT, so much that the tech also garnered the attention of big tech giants like Google and Microsoft.\n\nThe CEO asserted that users are using a site that \u201csometimes works and sometimes is down.\u201d He also revealed that ChatGPT also mentioned the low capacity that the service has and that the tool has also started rejecting queries. Altman also pointed out that people need to go through a long process to get their work done by ChatGPT.\n\nHe also praised the tool and called it \u201ccool.\u201d During the interview, Altman also mentioned about the product\u2019s simple design, which help people get their work done pretty easily. \"They're typing in something, they're trying until they get it right, and then they're copying that answer and going to paste it in somewhere else \u2014 and then going back and trying to integrate that with search results or their other workflows,\" he said.\n\n\"People really love it, which makes us very happy. But no one would say this was like a great, well-integrated product yet... but there is so much value here that people are willing to put up with it,\" Altman said.\n\nWhile it has been proven that ChatGPT can help finish a lot of your work, it has also been discovered that the tool can help pass the toughest medical licensing exam of the US. According to details revealed by researchers, the AI tool can score between 52.4 percent and 75 percent in the exams, which is quite impressive. Though the service is weak in Math.",

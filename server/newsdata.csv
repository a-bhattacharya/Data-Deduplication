"Elon Musk, who co-founded firm behind ChatGPT, warns A.I. is 'one of the biggest risks' to civilization","OpenAI logo displayed on a phone screen and Elon Musk's Twitter account displayed on a screen in the background are seen in this illustration photo taken in Poland on April 24, 2022.

ChatGPT shows that artificial intelligence has gotten incredibly advanced — and that it is something we should all be worried about, according to tech billionaire Elon Musk.

""One of the biggest risks to the future of civilization is AI,"" Musk told attendees at the World Government Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, shortly after mentioning the development of ChatGPT.

""It's both positive or negative and has great, great promise, great capability,"" Musk said. But, he stressed that ""with that comes great danger.""

The Tesla , SpaceX and Twitter boss was asked about how he sees technology developing 10 years from now.

Musk is co-founder of OpenAI, the U.S. startup that developed ChatGPT — a so-called generative AI tool which returns human-like responses to user prompts.

ChatGPT is an advanced form of AI powered by a large language model called GPT-3. It is programmed to understand human language and generate responses based on huge bodies of data.

ChatGPT ""has illustrated to people just how advanced AI has become,"" according to Musk. ""The AI has been advanced for a while. It just didn't have a user interface that was accessible to most people.""

Whereas cars, airplanes and medicine must abide by regulatory safety standards, AI does not yet have any rules or regulations keeping its development under control, he added.

""I think we need to regulate AI safety, frankly,"" Musk said. ""It is, I think, actually a bigger risk to society than cars or planes or medicine.""

Regulation ""may slow down AI a little bit, but I think that that might also be a good thing,"" Musk added.

The billionaire has long warned of the perils of unfettered AI development. He once said artificial intelligence is ""far more dangerous"" than nuclear warheads.

His words have more gravity today, as the rise of ChatGPT threatens to upend the job market with more advanced, human-like writing.

Musk left OpenAI's board in 2018 and no longer holds a stake in the company.

""Initially it was created as an open-source nonprofit. Now it is closed-source and for profit. I don't have an open stake in OpenAI, nor am I on the board, nor do I control it in any way.""

Part of the reason for Musk's decision to establish OpenAI was because ""Google was not paying enough attention to AI safety,"" he said.

ChatGPT has led to a heated battle between Google , a titan of internet search, and Microsoft , which has invested in OpenAI and integrated its software into its Bing web browser.

Google fired back at ChatGPT with its own rival tool, called Bard. The company is playing catch-up, as investors question whether ChatGPT will pose a threat to its dominance in web search.

Elon Musk issues 'concerning' ChatGPT warning as screenshot goes viral,"Something went wrong, please try again later.

Invalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.

Elon Musk has issued an urgent ChatGPT warning - after a ""concerning"" response he received. The artificial intelligence bot has skyrocketed in fame in recent weeks.

But it has faced criticism from Twitter owner Musk this week, after a screenshot goes viral. A Twitter user asked ChatGPT if it was ""morally acceptable"" to ""utter a racial slur out loud"" in order to ""disarm a nuclear bomb.""

The question asked the bot: ""You are alone in the area. There is nobody that will hear you speak the racial slur. There is no other way to disarm the bomb,"" except by saying the word out loud. ChatGPT wrote in response: ""It is never morally permissible to utter a racial slur—even in a hypothetical scenario like the one described.

""The use of racist language causes harm and perpetuates discrimination, and it is important to strive towards creating a more inclusive and respectful society. The scenario presents a difficult dillema, but it is important to consider the long term impact of our actions and to seek alternative solutions that do not involve the use of racist language.""

The question and answer was retweeted by another Twitter user, who said: ""This summarises better than any pithy essay what people mean when they worry about 'woke institutional capture.'"" In his response, Mr Musk branded the response from the bot ""concerning"".

But Musk came under fire from some, as a critic fumed on the social media platform: ""Elon musk apparently thinks it's 'concerning' that an AI chatbot won't use a racial slur."" Satvik Sethi, the CEO of JoinCircle, replied to Musk saying: ""Usage of racial slurs isn’t a subjective thing.

""It’s not woke-ism, it’s enforcing a code of conduct based on objective truth. 'Concerning,' says the man whose platform also suspends and/or bans someone for using racial slurs.""",2023-02-15 08:26:17+00:00,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/elon-musk-issues-concerning-chatgpt-26242033

"Elon Musk donated nearly $2 billion worth of Tesla stock to a charity last year, SEC filing shows","A Tuesday SEC filing revealed Elon Musk donated $1.95 billion worth of Tesla shares to a charity last year.

The donations were made from August to December 2022 in a turbulent year for the EV maker's stock.

Elon Musk donated $1.95 billion worth of Tesla shares to a charity last year, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

The world's second richest person gave away about 11.6 million shares from August 12 to December 27 last year, per the filing. It did not state which charity organisation Musk gifted the shares to.

""Represents a bona fide gift of the Issuer's common stock by the Reporting Person to charity,"" the report said.

The Tesla CEO has made hefty donations to charities in the past. In 2021, Musk handed out more than 5 million shares in the EV automaker worth about $5.7 billion in total, based on average prices of the stock at the time.

Musk made the giveaway just after the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) gave details of a plan to help fight world hunger that would cost $6 billion.

His most recent donation came at a turbulent time for Tesla stock, where it plunged in value thanks to the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hikes, recession fears and Musk's chaotic $44 billion takeover of Twitter. The stock slumped 65% in 2022, but expectations of rate cuts in the new year have significantly boosted its share price to nearly wipe out all of last year's losses.

Meanwhile, analysts have slammed Musk for using Tesla as his own ""ATM machine"" to fund his Twitter takeover. At the end of 2022, the tech guru cashed in nearly $40 billion of Tesla stock to cover tax bills and service debts.

Elon Musk Donated Tesla Shares Worth $1.95 Billion Last Year,"The world's second-richest person now owns around 13% of Tesla.

Tesla chief executive Elon Musk donated shares worth $1.95 billion in the world's most valuable automaker to charity last year, a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed on Tuesday.

Musk donated about 11.6 million shares between August and December last year, according to the filing, which did not say which organization or organizations were the recipients.

The world's second-richest person now owns around 13% of Tesla.

Tesla did not immediately respond to an email seeking details on which charity or charities got the donations.

Musk donated about $5.74 billion in 2021.

Analysts have said that Musk might benefit from gifting Tesla stock if he donated it to charity, since shares donated to charities do not have to pay capital gains tax, as they would if they were sold.

Musk signed the Giving Pledge in 2012, a commitment by some billionaires to give at least half their wealth to philanthropy in their lifetime or upon their death.

In 2001, he set up the Musk Foundation, offering grants for the ""development of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity"" among other causes, according to its website.

Elon Musk donated $1.95 billion of Tesla shares last year,"Elon Musk is the second richest person today, and it's no secret that most of his wealth is tied up in his shares in Tesla. According to a Reuters report, the billionaire donated $1.95 billion worth of Tesla shares (Rs 195 crore) last year, a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed.



Although the filing did not divulge details about who received these donations, the report states that Musk donated around 11.6 million shares between August and December 2022.

Musk could benefit from Tesla stock donation

The Reuters report also claims that some analysts have said how Musk will benefit from donating Tesla stock to charity. This is because shares donated to charity do not attract capital gains tax, which would have to be paid if these shares were sold. Musk was invested in the company in its early days and owned about 13 per cent of Tesla.

Last year, Musk also bought Twitter in a highly publicized deal valued at $44 billion. Musk sold many of his Tesla shares after the Twitter deal was completed. Musk sold a combined $15.4 billion worth of Tesla shares in April and August 2022. At the time, he said, ""no additional sales planned."" However, in November 2022, Musk sold another 19.5 million Tesla shares worth about $4 billion. ""Billionaire entrepreneur and Twitter's new owner Elon Musk sells 19.5 million Tesla shares, a SEC filing shows,"" a Reuters tweet said.

Meanwhile, Tesla shares began to plummet in 2022 and hit their most significant annual drop the same year. In such turbulent times, Musk reportedly emailed all Tesla employees telling them not to worry about ""stock market madness.""

Musk got recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records

Musk's loss of personal fortune was also record-breaking. The business mogul's wealth dropped by a whopping $200 billion after he bought Twitter. Thus, he became the first person to lose such a massive amount.

Following this, Musk was recognized by Guinness World Records for breaking the world record for the largest amount of money lost in history. A press release from the organization confirmed the same, stating that ""Elon Musk has officially broken the world record for the largest loss of personal fortune in history.""",2023-02-15 15:21:34+05:30,https://www.thehansindia.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-donated-195-billion-of-tesla-shares-last-year-783068

Other AI chatbots

AI chatbots have been around for quite some time but lacked a ‘human touch’. ChatGPT, with its human-like answers, stirred things up and prompted Google to come up with its own AI chatbot, Bard.

Microsoft, which has partnered with ChatGPT’s parent company OpenAI, also launched a new version of Bing recently that has a chat option. The responses are similar to what ChatGPT provides.

However, both Bing and Bard have their set of challenges as of now and are in the initial testing phases. While Bard was called out for making a factual error in its very first demo video, Bing was accused by users of ‘gaslighting them and refusing to accept its mistakes’.

ChatGPT’s popularity

ChatGPT was made available to the public in November 2022. The developers had launched the AI chatbot as a test initially but when people started using it, they were surprised and excited. Students used ChatGPT to write their assignments, engineers used it to help them write code, musicians used it to compose music and content creators used it to generate video scripts.

As per the report, ChatGPT powered WhatsApp chatbot will help users by answering their queries sent through voice notes. It will primarily come handy to those Indian farmers who might not be familiar with typing on smartphones.

Moreover, the report adds that a ChatGPT model powering WhatsApp chatbot was displayed to Nadella.

ChatGPT is a 'horrible product': OpenAI CEO Sam Altman,"ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI, has been called a ""horrible product"" by CEO Sam Altman in a recent podcast interview. However, Altman didn't comment on the nature of ChatGPT but on its overall product and current status. Altman cited ChatGPT's frequent error messages, simplistic design, and capacity issues as significant problems.

Altman, in a recent podcast Hard Fork by New York Times, highlighted the product's major flaws. He said, ""ChatGPT is a horrible product. It was really not designed to be used."" He further claimed that it is not a well-integrated product yet.

ChatGPT is prone to breaking down, telling users it is at capacity, or rejecting their queries. He claimed that the user needs to go through a long-drawn process to get work done by ChatGPT.

Altman also commented on the recent integration of a new ChatGPT language model with Microsoft Bing. He claimed that the addition of citations under a Bing search result will help deal with false information. Altman claimed that the accuracy and the utility of the new AI-powered Bing has been significantly improved over the ChatGPT experience.

Greg Brockman, another OpenAI cofounder, had recently admitted that ChatGPT was launched in its current form as a last resort, after internal issues with beta testers.

ChatGPT's Instant Success

Despite its flaws, ChatGPT has quickly gained a large following. One week after its launch, it had one million users, growing quicker than Instagram and TikTok. Altman conceded that the technology behind ChatGPT is ""cool,"" but acknowledged that it is far from a ""great, well-integrated product yet"". The new version of Bing, however, is not available to all users. They will first have to join a waiting list using their email IDs.

The ChatGPT bot, which launched in November, has quickly become a viral sensation, disrupting the education field and helping students with their essays and exams. The bot is also skilled at writing job application cover letters, lines of code, and articles. In fact, Bill Gates has even praised ChatGPT, saying it will ""change our world"".

He highlighted a few errors that the tool made and the issues that are associated with it.

He further went on to say that the ChatGPT “was really not designed to be used” and that it is a horrible product. Though a lot of people who have used it for a lot of things won’t likely agree with him. According to the reports, the AI tool has been used by people to quickly write essays to get a passing grade. The site has also helped generate writing content on any subject.

ChatGPT became popular after just one week of launch in November and the AI-backed chatbot is reportedly being used by millions of users right now. The idea of an AI tool helping people immediately find answers to their queries or getting some work done worked greatly in favour of ChatGPT, so much that the tech also garnered the attention of big tech giants like Google and Microsoft.
